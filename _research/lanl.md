At Los Alamos National Lab, I worked with two staff scientists on a project examining multiphase flow simulations in subsurface fractures.

#### Problem & Motivation

Multiphase flow properties of fractures are important for a variety of engineering applications, one being the injection and storage of fluid CO<sub>2</sub> underground. Lattice Boltzmann (LBM) simulations can be used to study these properties, but these physics-based simulations require high-performance computing resources and are limited in their domain size.  

We present a physics-constrained **deep convolutional neural network (CNN)** that trains on a few LBM simulations and can quickly and accurately predict the displacement of water by supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> through time with **95% accuracy**. The goal is to map the characteristics of a 3D fracture to the position of an injected fluid mass of CO<sub>2</sub> at multiple timesteps, interpolating between the original simulations with accurate ML predictions that take into account interfacial tension between fluids, fluid-solid interactions, and complex geometries.
