Hi! I'm Allen, a computer science and communications student at the University of Texas at Austin. I have worked in a variety of environments in both academia and industry, developing skills in software development, data science, machine learning techniques, research, and business communication. Previously, I have interned at Dell Technologies and Los Alamos National Laboratory. My interests include software, machine learning and its applications to broad societal and environmental issues, and natural language processing.  

Check out some of my [research projects](/research/) and other work in software development.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, playing the guitar, playing basketball and volleyball, and singing in an [a cappella group](https://www.instagram.com/utransomnotes/).


(*And of course keeping up with Texas football!*)
